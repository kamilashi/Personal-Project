# DISCLAIMER
Another text-based game (this time an RPG) - with 4 playable characters - in the making.

This project is only intended for educational purposes.
The setting of the game is based on China Mi√©ville's Bas Lag novels. The portraits used as character icons were done by Nick Runge, and the map by Lee Moyer. 
I do not own any of the items mentioned above.
